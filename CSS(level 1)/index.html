    <h1>Avengers</h1>
    <hr><br>
    <p>The logo theory posits that the Avengers logo, specifically the circle around the "A," acts as a visual foreshadowing of the movie's outcome.
    A full circle around the "A" (as seen in The Avengers and Endgame) indicates the Avengers winning.
    A half circle (as seen in Infinity War) indicates the Avengers losing.
    The theory suggests this pattern will continue in future films like Avengers: Doomsday (full circle, victory) and Avengers: Secret Wars (half circle, loss)</p>

    <h2>Publication History</h2>
    <p>This theory suggests that instead of dying, Tony Stark uploaded his consciousness into his technology, becoming an AI.
    A fan theory on Reddit cites a comic book storyline where Iron Man's consciousness becomes AI after his death.
    The theory points to the "hologram" of Tony turning to face Morgan at the end of Endgame as evidence, suggesting the hologram knew her exact location, which a regular hologram wouldn't. </p>

    <h2>Fictional Charavter Biography</h2>
    <p>Several characters in the Avengers universe have been the subject of fan theories and
        discussions regarding their bisexuality. While not explicitly stated in all cases,
        these characters are often cited as examples of potential or ambiguous LGBTQ+ representation.
        Loki, with his shapeshifting abilities and portrayal in Norse mythology, is often considered
        genderfluid and bisexual in comics and adaptations. Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson, is 
        canonically bisexual in the MCU, with her sexuality alluded to in the films and confirmed by 
        Thompson. Tony Stark's interactions with both men and women have led to fan theories of bisexuality, 
        particularly in relation to his relationships with Steve Rogers and Doctor Strange. The inclusion of 
        a grieving man in "Avengers: Endgame" was also intended 
        as a representation of everyday LGBTQ+ life, though some found it</p>
